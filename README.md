# DTC  
This is a program I wrote in the past during college.\
Unfortunately, I couldn't find the source files. So, I just copied the source code from the written work from school and pasted into Notepad. I saved the files as the original file types. It's easier to read it in the coloured version in the .docx file.\

This program encrypts text using my own algorithm. Can be used for fun, to communicate secretly so that other people can't read what was sent in communicators or for creating strong passwords.\
\
If you happen to find this, please let me know that you would like to use my program and for what purpose. Thanks.\
Oh, and the interface is in Polish. ;-) But there's very little text.
